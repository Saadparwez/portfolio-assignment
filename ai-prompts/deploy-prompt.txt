The deployment setup for the portfolio application:

- The project deploys automatically using Google Cloud Build Triggers, not GitHub Actions.
- A Cloud Build trigger is connected to the GitHub repository (branch: main).
- On each push to the main branch:
    - Cloud Build pulls the latest code from GitHub
    - Builds the Docker image using the Dockerfile at the repo root
    - Pushes the image to Artifact Registry
    - Deploys the new image to Cloud Run
    - Cloud Run hosts the live portfolio website and automatically updates when Cloud Build completes successfully.

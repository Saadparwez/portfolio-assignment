Rules I Developed for Using AI During this Project

This document outlines the personal rules and constraints I established for using AI tools throughout the development of my portfolio application. These rules were created to ensure that I remained actively engaged in the development process, maintained ownership of the work, and used AI in a responsible, structured way.

1. AI Should Assist, Not Replace My Development Work

I allowed AI to help generate parts of the implementation (such as React components, Tailwind utility structures, layout ideas, or configuration snippets), but I reviewed, edited, and integrated every piece of code myself. I did not paste anything without understanding how it worked.

2. I Had to Understand Every Line of Code Before Using It

If AI generated code that I could not personally explain, I was not allowed to use it.
I required myself to:

Read the code line-by-line
Ask clarifying questions when needed
Modify the code until I could validate its purpose
This rule ensured the project remained my work, not just AI output.

3. AI Cannot Make Architectural Decisions Without My Oversight

I used AI for suggestions, but I made the final decisions about:

Component structure
State management
Folder organization
Nav/menu logic
Deployment workflow
Dockerfile configuration

AI could propose options, but I chose the approach and adapted it myself.

4. AI Must Not Be Used to Generate the Required Reflection Essay

Per assignment instructions, all reflective writing had to be done without AI assistance.
This rule ensured academic integrity for the essay portion of the project.

5. Prompts Must Be Specific, Context-Rich, and Intentional

I required myself to:

Provide context such as existing code, folder structure, or error messages
Ask for revisions instead of new solutions when appropriate
Avoid vague prompts like “build this for me”
This rule helped me improve my prompt engineering and maintain project clarity.

6. AI Output Had to Be Tested Locally Before Acceptance

Before integrating AI-generated code, I tested it locally to ensure:

No runtime errors
